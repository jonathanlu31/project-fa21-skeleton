To generate outputs, simply run python3 solver.py. You can change whether you want to generate the small, medium, or large outputs by going to the end of the solver.py file where main is and changing the input/output paths.
For example, if you wanted the medium outputs, there are 2 parts that you have to change to 'inputs/medium/' and one part to change to 'outputs/medium/'
